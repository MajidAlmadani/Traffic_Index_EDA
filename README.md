# Traffic_Index_EDA

Welcome to the Traffic Index Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This project aims to analyze traffic congestion data from various cities to derive insights and make data-driven decisions to improve traffic conditions. The dataset includes metrics such as real-time traffic index, number of traffic jams, delays, and lengths of traffic jams, among others.

## Key Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Detailed examination of traffic congestion metrics.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigation of relationships between different traffic-related variables.
- **City-Specific Insights**: Identification of cities with the highest traffic congestion.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Strategies to mitigate traffic jams based on data insights.

## Findings:
- Dubai has the highest traffic congestion.
- Strong positive correlations among most numerical variables.
- Early intervention can help manage and reduce traffic jams effectively.

## Recommendations:
- Focus on improving road efficiency in high congestion cities.
- Deploy traffic officers strategically to manage traffic proactively.
